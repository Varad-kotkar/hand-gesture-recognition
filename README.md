# hand-gesture-recognition
A deep learning-based system that recognizes 10 static hand gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built using the LeapGestRecog dataset, this project is part of the SCT Machine Learning Track (Task 4) and aims to demonstrate practical computer vision skills using TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.
